## Minecraft in AR

### Introduction

For the final project, I am planning to make a simple analogy about Minecraft in the WebAR context. To be detailed, there will be a set of AR markers that will represent different blocks such as forest block, grass block, water block, animal block, and ground block. Users can put these markers around the physical world and the corresponding blocks will be displayed in the browser. This will give users a feeling of modifying reality and making changes on the virtual AR world.

### TechStack

- Three.js, will be used as the 3D rendering engine.
- AR.js, a library that is built on top of Three.js. It will offer the AR marker generator and detector.
- 3D modeling tools, if it is possible, I can do the 3D modeling on myself.
